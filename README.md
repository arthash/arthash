# arthash

hash all the art.


artHash is a free, open-source system for digital artists to publish unique fingerprints of their work.

A hash is a unique fingerprint of a document, a little chunk of text that can be shared publicly to prove ownership of work without exposing any of it to unauthorized copying.

Dragging documents and directories onto the artHash application generates a unique hash using the high-quality SHA-256 algorithm, which may be published and disseminated for further identity security of digital artworks.


USAGE:

1.) Download the project. 

Direct link: https://github.com/rec/arthash/archive/master.zip

2.) The archive contains a directory that has an Automator application in it called "arthash".   It looks like a robot. Drag it to wherever you wish.

3.) Drag and drop the artwork you wish to hash on the robot icon. The hash is saved in the same folder, and with the same name as the source file with ".sha256.txt" appended. 
NOTES: 
• If Mac says '"arthash" can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer', open System Preferences / Security & Privacy / General and click on "Open Anyway" or change your security preferences to allow apps dowloaded from "Anywhere"
• Small files hash quickly, large files take some time.
