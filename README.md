# arthash

hash all the art.

A FLOSS utility for generating and confirming hashes from any digital file, especially art ;)


USAGE:

1.) Download the project. 

Direct link: https://github.com/rec/arthash/archive/master.zip

2.) The archive contains a directory that has an Automator application in it called "arthash".   It looks like a robot. Drag it to wherever you wish.

3.) Drag and drop the artwork you wish to hash on the robot icon. The hash is saved in the same folder as the source file. 

Small files hash quickly, large files take some time.
