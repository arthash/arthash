# arthash

hash all the art.


artHash is a free, open-source system for digital artists to publish unique fingerprints of their work.

A hash is a unique fingerprint of a document, a little chunk of text that can be shared publicly to prove ownership of work without exposing any of it to unauthorized copying.

Dragging documents and directories onto the artHash application generates a unique hash using the high-quality SHA-256 algorithm, which may be published and disseminated for further identity security of digital artworks.
