# arthash

hash all the art.

A FLOSS utility for generating and confirming hashes from any digital file, especially art ;)


USAGE:
Download the project - you can do it from that page or here's a direct link:
https://github.com/rec/arthash/archive/master.zip

Now, that directory has an Automator application in it called "arthash".   It looks like a robot.
